# super-tiny-liverpool-compiler
Its the [The Super Tiny Compiler][1]  but instead of numbers you write liverpool players

- So if you were a human being with some sort of issues you would write: `(add 2 (subtract 10 5))`
- But since you are a proper G, you will write the same operation like : `(add GOMEZ (subtract MACALLSTER KONATE))`
- Players' jersey number will be treated as number for the operation 

### TABLE COMING SOON
I will add a table PLAYER -> JERSEY NUMBER later for all those f*cks who dont support Liverpool

### YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE
